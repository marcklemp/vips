# vips.el

`vips.el` is a simple but powerful Emacs interface for OpenAI's GPT API, text-to-speech API, and DeepL's translation API. This tool allows you to leverage the capabilities of these APIs directly within your Emacs environment.

## Key Features

- Work directly with OpenAI's LLM models, such as GPT-4 and GPT-4 Turbo, in Emacs.
- Directly interact with OpenAI's text-to-speech model, enabling the output to be played within Emacs (if your version supports it) or through your operating system's default player.
- The synthesized speech can be saved as an mp3 file for future reference and use.
- Customize parameters for OpenAI's API, including max tokens, temperature, top-p, frequency penalty, and presence penalty to fine-tune the output.
- Translate text seamlessly using the DeepL API.
- Choose your target language for translation.

## Installation Steps

1. Download `vips.el` to your local system.
2. Add the directory containing `vips.el` to your `load-path` using `(add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/your/directory")`.
3. Load the package with `(require 'vips)`.

## How to Use

Activate `vips-mode` in your Emacs buffer by executing `M-x vips-mode`.

Once `vips-mode` is active, you can easily interact with OpenAI's GPT models and DeepL's translation API to enhance your productivity within Emacs.

### Interacting with OpenAI's GPT Models

You can send text to OpenAI's models and receive AI-generated responses. Even without setting system messages, the GPT models will operate effectively in a standard manner.

- `C-c <left>`: Send selected text to GPT-4 and insert the response.
- `C-c <right>`: Send selected text to GPT-4 Turbo and insert the response.
- `C-c <down>`: Choose a specific model and send selected text to it.
- `C-c C-a C-c`: Mark text from the start of the buffer to the current position and run GPT-4 Turbo.
- `C-c C-a C-v`: Run GPT-4 Turbo on the entire buffer.
- `C-c .`: Play the selected text in your operating system's default player.
- `C-c C-d C-s`: Display currently selected system messages.

### Customizing AI Responses with System Messages

For more tailored interactions, you can define system messages that provide context or instructions to the AI model. These messages are divided into two categories: main system messages and add-on messages.

- **Main System Messages**: Set general instructions or roles for the AI, like "You are a helpful assistant."
- **Add-On Messages**: Specify additional guidelines, such as "Use Markdown markup."

#### Managing System Messages

- Use `M-x vips-select-main-system-message` and `M-x vips-select-addon-message` to choose main and add-on messages respectively.
- The selected messages are combined automatically and sent with your text to the AI.
- Clear selected messages with `M-x vips-clear-selected-message` if you wish to reset the AI's context.
- View the current combined message with `M-x vips-display-selected-messages`.

### Translating Text with DeepL

Translate text directly within Emacs using DeepL's powerful translation API.

- `C-c SPC`: Select output language, translate the selected text using DeepL, and append the translation.

Additional functions are available for invocation through `M-x` or by binding them to your own custom keybindings. Below is a list of interactive functions not included in the default keybindings:

### Unbound Interactive Functions

#### Voice Selection
- `vips-select-voice`: Prompt the user to select a voice for text-to-speech synthesis from a predefined list of voices. The selected voice will be used for generating audio from text.

#### Language Selection for Translation
- `vips-select-language`: Allow the user to select a target language for translation via DeepL's API. The chosen language will be used for translating text from the buffer.

#### System Message Management
- `vips-clear-main-system-message`: Clear the currently selected main system message that is sent to OpenAI's API along with the user's prompt.
- `vips-clear-addon-message`: Clear the currently selected add-on message that can be appended to the main system message for additional context or instructions.
- `vips-clear-both-messages`: Clear both the selected main system message and the add-on message.
- `vips-clear-selected-message`: Prompt the user to select which message to clear: the main system message, the add-on message, or both.

#### System Message Selection
- `vips-select-main-system-message`: Prompt the user to select a main system message from a predefined list. This message provides context or instructions for OpenAI's API.
- `vips-select-addon-message`: Prompt the user to select an add-on message from a predefined list that can be combined with the main system message.

#### System Message Combination
- `vips-combine-messages`: Combine the selected main system message with the selected add-on message and store it in a global variable for use in API requests.

#### Speech Synthesis
- `vips-create-and-play-speech`: Generate speech from the selected text region and play it using Emacs' built-in audio playback capabilities.
- `vips-create-and-save-speech`: Generate speech from the selected text region and save it to a specified location on the user's filesystem.

#### Speech Synthesis with OS Integration
- `vips-create-and-play-speech-with-os`: Generate speech from the selected text region, save it to a temporary file, and play it using the operating system's default media player.

These functions enhance your interaction with AI services by providing additional customization and control over the behavior of `vips.el`. To use these functions, you can either invoke them through `M-x` followed by the function name or bind them to custom keybindings in your Emacs configuration for quicker access.

### Configuration

Before using `vips-mode`, configure your API keys for OpenAI and DeepL in your Emacs settings.

To use this tool, you must have valid API keys for GPT and/or DeepL.

Add the following code to your config.el file:

```emacs-lisp
(setq openai-api-key "<your-openai-key-here>")
(setq deepl-api-key "<your-deepl-key-here>")
```

Replace <your-openai-key-here> and <your-deepl-key-here> with your actual API keys.

The `vips-languages` variable contains the list of language codes available for the translation function, initially set to include Danish ("DA") and English ("EN"). To modify this list, you can add a `setq` form to your Emacs configuration file (.emacs or init.el), like so:

```emacs-lisp
(setq vips-languages '("DA" "EN" "DE" "FR"))
```

This will add German ("DE") and French ("FR") to the list of available languages.

With `vips-mode`, you have the flexibility to use GPT models in their standard configuration or customize their responses with system messages. This allows for a personalized experience whether you're drafting documents, coding, or communicating in multiple languages.
